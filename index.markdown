I'm a fourth year undergraduate at Duke University, double majoring in computer science and math. 

Before attending Duke, I attended Washington University in St. Louis for my first year of college.

My interests are focused around algorithms and statistics. Studies aside, I enjoy tennis, computer illustration/photography, minimalist UI/UX design, and cooking. Occasionally, I will competitively program as I did on Washington University's ICPC team.

You can find some stuff about me in my resume [here.]({{ felixwho.github.io }}/assets/Felix_Resume.pdf)
