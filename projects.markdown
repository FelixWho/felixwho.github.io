## Synopsis of some stuff I've done in my free time

### Buzzfund | Spring 2020

An options trading assistant that leverages criterion backtesting and machine learning models to determine option profitability. Collaborated with some talented friends and overall the project has brought in good returns. Private Github due to confidential financial data.

### Safinia | Spring 2020

A Washington University Sling Health backed initiative that uses NLP to answer users' questions on medical terms and diseases. This project is partnered with St. Louis city schools and the WashU School of Medicine. Private Github due to organization policy.

### BULLSEYE | Capital One Summit Hackathon | Winter 2020

Find commonalities in entertainment preferences to pinpoint activies of interest to a group of users. Used TensorFlow on transaction history to discover user preferences and Google Maps API to discover interesting locations. https://github.com/FelixWho/c1-summit

### ShureSoundVisualization | Dare Mighty Things Hackathon | Fall 2019

A proof of concept for audio quality testing. Our initial goal was to compare audio in a room to a ground truth audio to test the room's acoustic quality. While this proved too challenging to complete in a night, it was a fun build with good people involved! https://github.com/FelixWho/ShureSoundVisualization

### MuSiC2 | Ding Lab | 2018 - 2019

Built visualization and genomic data analysis tools in R and Python for Ding Lab. Utilized dimensional reduction techniques as well as other algorithms to simplify visualization.  My first introduction to genomics was eye-opening; thanks to Dr. Ding and Dr. Wyczalkowski for being great mentors.

### Red Scare and Mortal Brombat | Spring 2018

Two games built in UCI game Java framework. Built out of boredom to service your boredom. https://github.com/FelixWho/RedScare, https://github.com/FelixWho/MortalBrombat
