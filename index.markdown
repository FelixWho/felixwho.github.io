I'm a third year undergraduate at Duke University, majoring in computer science+math, and minoring in bioinformatics. 

Before attending Duke, I had an incredible first year at Washington University in St. Louis. Major shoutouts to my amazing professors there including [Dr. Li Ding](https://dinglab.wustl.edu/), who introduced me to cancer genomics back in high school.

My interests are focused around algorithms, statistics, and genomics. Studies aside, I enjoy tennis, computer illustration/photography, minimalist UI/UX design (interesting Jekyll theme huh), and concocting foods in my kitchen. Occasionally, I will competitively program as I did on Washington University's ICPC team.

You can find some stuff about me in my resume [here.]({{ felixwho.github.io }}/assets/Felix_Resume.pdf)
