I'm a second year undergraduate at Duke University, majoring in computer science, and minoring in bioinformatics and entrepreneurship. Before attending Duke, I had an incredible first year at Washington University in St. Louis. Major shoutouts to my amazing professors including [Dr. Li Ding](https://dinglab.wustl.edu/), who introduced me to cancer genomics back in high school.

My interests are focused around algorithms, statistics, and genomics. Studies aside, I enjoy tennis, computer illustration/photography, and exploring foods. Occasionally, I will competitively program.
